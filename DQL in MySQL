-- Assuming we have a table named 'users' with columns 'id', 'username', and 'email'

-- Retrieve all records from the 'users' table
SELECT * FROM users;

-- Retrieve specific columns from 'users'
SELECT username, email FROM users;

-- Retrieve records with a condition
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;

-- Retrieve records with multiple conditions
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE 'A%' AND email LIKE '%example.com';

-- Retrieve records with sorting
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY username ASC;

-- Retrieve records with grouping and aggregate functions
SELECT country, COUNT(*) as total_users FROM users GROUP BY country;

-- Retrieve records with joins (example assumes a 'posts' table with 'user_id' foreign key)
SELECT u.username, p.title FROM users u INNER JOIN posts p ON u.id = p.user_id;

-- Retrieve records with subqueries
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id IN (SELECT user_id FROM posts WHERE category = 'Tech');

-- Retrieve limited records
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10;

-- Retrieve records with pagination (MySQL example)
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20
